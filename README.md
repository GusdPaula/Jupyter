# Linear Regression using the close's price of Bitcoin and Ethereum between the begin of this year (2022) until november 30th of the same year.

The purpose of this analysis was a work that I had to do for econometrics subject at university.

It is only a simple analysis of the correlaction between the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum. I will create a post on the Medium to explain with more details what I did here, but I saw that at this year the close price of these two cryptocurrency have correlated. What can indicate that have the two in your wallet was not a good option of diversification.

I used some librarys in python to create all the analysi - like pandas, seaborn, numpy etc. - and a API of this website: 'https://cryptowat.ch/pt-br'.

As soon as I create the web post on Medium I will put the link here.

If you have some correction or tip, please, let me know!

Thank you!
